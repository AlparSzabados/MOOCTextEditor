This is my solution to the **MOOCTextEditor** project, which is the learning code  
for the *Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance course*.  

Developed the back-end code for a text editor/processor that incorporates
“intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, 
flagging misspelled words, spelling auto-correct and calculating Flash index.

All the files that I implemented or modified have my name as author.
